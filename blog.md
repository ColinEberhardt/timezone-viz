## 1900

- of the 282 named timezones, there are 220 different offsets, and no DST
- a great many or not multiples of hours

- Only changes were a few countries moving to integer offsets,
  e.g. America/Sitka => On Aug 20 12:00 moved from -9:01:13 to -8:00
  America/Yakutat, -9:18:55 to -9:00

- while the IANA timezone database groups by zones, this isn't a fair representation of
  how time was tracked at the time - there were no zone. Time was set locally within towns or villages, when the sun hit its peak

### Railroad influence - Sir Sandford Fleming

- when there was little travel, this didn't cause much issue
- introduction of railroads, which required timetabling, this was a major factor

- "Fifty-six standards of time are now employed by the various railroads of the country in preparing their schedules of running times," reported the front page of the New York Times on April 19, 1883.

- On April 11, 1883, in St. Louis, Missouri, railroad officials agreed to create five time zones in North America: Provincial, Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Pacific.

- In 1878, Sir Sandford Fleming (born in Scotland, emigrated to Canada when 18) proposed the system of worldwide time zones that we use today, based on an antimeridian (the opposite of the prime meridian which we use today) at Greenwhich.

- petitioned many conferences

- In 1884 an International Meridian Conference was held in Washington D.C. to standardize time and select the prime meridian. They selected Greenwhich, but rejected the zones, considering that a local issue

- The United States government made the time zones official bypassing the Standard Time Act in 1918

## Daylight savings time

The concept is simple, we live by clocks, same routine. However, daylight is seasonal. A one hour offset

- The idea to manipulate clocks is often attributed to 1784 by Benjamin Franklin, to economize candle usage
- however, rather than adjust the clocks, he simply encouraged people to get up earlier - enouraged by
  church bells, or canon. proverb "early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise"

Port Arthur business man, John Hewitson, with the desire to enjoy an extra hour of summer sun, petitioned the councils of Port Arthur and Fort William in 1908, the first town to adopt daylight saving

The first states to adopt DST (German: Sommerzeit) nationally were those of the German Empire and its World War I ally Austria-Hungary commencing April 30, 1916, as a way to conserve coal during wartime.

In the US, congress didn't make the use of these time zones mandatory until the Standard Time Act of 1918, with DST being known as "War Time", saving fuel and energy in WWI.

In the summer of 1940, the German military authorities switched the occupied northern part of Metropolitan France to GMT+2 (German summer time)

Elsewhere, soviets captured Lithuania, and moved it to Moscow's timezone, a shift of 2 hours, in June 1940

Later, we see the impact of german occupation, when in the Winter of 1942 much of Europe moves to the same winter time
